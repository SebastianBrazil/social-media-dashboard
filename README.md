3/18/24: I started the project and made decent work on the top half of the website. My milestones will be completing the desktop version, completing the mobile version, and then doing the dark mode for both. 
3/20/24: I completed the top half of the website and started work on the bottom half. I also created a function that should handle the dark mode switch, but haven't tested it out. 
3/21/24: I completed the whole website for the desktop, as well as the function for the dark mode. My next step is completing the dark mode and the hovers, then do mobile last.
3/22/24: I completed the dark mode and the hovers, all thats left is the mobile.
