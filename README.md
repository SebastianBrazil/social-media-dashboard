Social Media Dashboard in React

Designed at 1440 by 900 px, 375 by 700 px. This project was intended to create a social media dashboard website based off of still images. The design and colors were given, all that was needed was to create the code for it.

3/18/24: I started the project and made decent work on the top half of the website. My milestones will be completing the desktop version, completing the mobile version, and then doing the dark mode for both. 
3/20/24: I completed the top half of the website and started work on the bottom half. I also created a function that should handle the dark mode switch, but haven't tested it out. 
3/21/24: I completed the whole website for the desktop, as well as the function for the dark mode. My next step is completing the dark mode and the hovers, then do mobile last.
3/22/24 pt-1: I completed the dark mode and the hovers, all thats left is the mobile.
3/22/24 pt-2: Completed mobile, finished.
3/22/24 pt-3: Implemented peer review comments, added interfaces.

Amazing work, the website is very similar to the design images. The main component of dark and light mode works as intended. A couple of things that I noticed that are differences between the design and the application. In the desktop design, there should be more margin/padding at the bottom of the screen. When going down screen sizes, the cards are touching together. I would suggest using the gap className if you're using flex-box. The mobile looks amazing! Another thing I wanted to point out is that I heard from one of the TAs that you should be using react components and passing through props for reusable components. I'm not entirely sure, but other than that. Great job!
